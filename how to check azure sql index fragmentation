To automate this maintenance process we need the ability to find problematic Indexes. The following Stored Procedure will return a list of Index names and their average fragmentation as a percent values. Be sure to replace the DatabaseName with the name of the database you are working with.

CREATE PROCEDURE [dbo].[GetIndexFragmentation]
    @tableName nvarchar(max)
AS
SELECT name, avg_fragmentation_in_percent
FROM sys.dm_db_index_physical_stats (
       DB_ID(N'DatabaseName')
     , OBJECT_ID(@tableName)
     , NULL
     , NULL
     , NULL) AS a
JOIN sys.indexes AS b 
ON a.object_id = b.object_id AND a.index_id = b.index_id;


Running the following T-SQL on a SQL Database, you can get the index fragmentation on a specific table in percent:

SELECT name, avg_fragmentation_in_percent

FROM sys.dm_db_index_physical_stats (

       DB_ID(N’MyDatabaseName’)

     , OBJECT_ID(‘MyTableName’)

     , NULL

     , NULL

     , NULL) AS a

JOIN sys.indexes AS b

ON a.object_id = b.object_id AND a.index_id = b.index_id

If you want to get all the indexes in a database with more than a 30% of fragmentation, you can run this other one:

SELECT name, avg_fragmentation_in_percent

FROM sys.dm_db_index_physical_stats (

       DB_ID(N’MyDatabaseName’)

     , NULL

     , NULL

     , NULL

     , NULL) AS a

JOIN sys.indexes AS b

ON a.object_id = b.object_id AND a.index_id = b.index_id

WHERE avg_fragmentation_in_percent > 30
