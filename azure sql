To automate this maintenance process we need the ability to find problematic Indexes. The following Stored Procedure will return a list of Index names and their average fragmentation as a percent values. Be sure to replace the DatabaseName with the name of the database you are working with.

CREATE PROCEDURE [dbo].[GetIndexFragmentation]
    @tableName nvarchar(max)
AS
SELECT name, avg_fragmentation_in_percent
FROM sys.dm_db_index_physical_stats (
       DB_ID(N'DatabaseName')
     , OBJECT_ID(@tableName)
     , NULL
     , NULL
     , NULL) AS a
JOIN sys.indexes AS b 
ON a.object_id = b.object_id AND a.index_id = b.index_id;
